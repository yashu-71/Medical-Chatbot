Obstructive shock results from an obstruction\\n(impairment) of blood flow to the heart. Causes of obstructive shock\\ninclude lar ge blood clots in blood vessels supplying the lungs\\n(pulmonary embolism) or a severely deflated lung (tension\\npneumothorax).\\nCommon causes of shock\\nShock may result for the following reasons:\\nBlood loss.

A reduction in body fluids from vomiting, diarrhea and\\ndecreased fluid intake also can lead to hypovolemic shock.\\nHeart conditions.

It’ s most often\\ntransmitted to humans by the saliva of an infected animal. However ,\\na bite isn’ t necessary to transmit the virus. Even a licking from an\\ninfected animal can spread the disease if the animal’ s saliva comes\\nin contact with an existing wound.\\nThe rabies virus often takes one to three months to produce\\nsymptoms, and it can take much longer . If you think you may have\\nbeen exposed to rabies, consult your doctor or health department\\nright away . For more information on rabies, see here .\\nIn the event of a bite by an animal, the animal should be caught,\\nconfined and observed by a veterinarian or animal control\\nprofessional for up to \\x00\\x00 days. If you can’ t catch the animal — as is\\noften the case with wild animals — then contact your local health\\ndepartment, natural resources or law enforcement of ficials. The\\nanimal may have to be killed, and in such a way that its brain isn’ t\\ndamaged. Health or law enforcement of ficials will arrange testing of\\nthe animal for rabies.

The reflex is often strong\\nenough to make the child fall of f something if he or she is not being\\nwatched. The startle reflex gradually disappears by the third month of life.\\nThe grasp reﬂex\\nStroking your infant sets of f several responses. When you stroke the palm\\nof his or her hand, your baby grasps your finger (palmar reflex). When you\\nstroke the sole of your baby’ s foot, you’ll see the toes turn downward, as if\\ntrying to grasp something (plantar reflex). The palmar reflex disappears at\\nabout age \\x00 months. The plantar reflex continues until \\x00\\x00 months of age.\\nThe rooting and sucking reﬂexes\\nRooting and sucking are two of your infant’ s important reflexes. Stroking\\nthe baby’ s cheek or lips with a nipple or finger produces the rooting reflex.\\nThe baby turns toward the stroking object and tries to bring it near the\\nmouth. The sucking reflex is initiated once the object is taken into the\\nbaby’ s mouth.\\nSucking and rooting reflexes usually diminish by the time the infant is \\x00\\nmonths old, although these reflexes can often be produced in a sleeping\\ninfant until the seventh month.', metadata={'source': 'S:\\\\Projects\\\\Medical-Chat-Bot\\\\Data\\\\Doraemon maya.pdf', 'page': 409}),\n",

A strong blink reflex protects the newborn’ s\\neyes from glaring light.
